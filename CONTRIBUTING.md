## Getting started

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you find an issue with the repository or have a feature request with Spacedrive, [search if an issue already exists](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form](https://github.com/spacedriveapp/spacedrive/issues/new/choose).

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/spacedriveapp/spacedrive/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. See [Labels](https://github.com/spacedriveapp/spacedrive/labels) for more information. As a general rule. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Make Changes

#### Make changes locally

This project uses [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation). Ensure you have them installed before continuing.

> Note: MacOS M1 users should choose the customize option in the rustup init script and enter `x86_64-apple-darwin` as the default host triple instead of the default `aarch64-apple-darwin`

- `git clone https://github.com/spacedriveapp/spacedrive`
- `cd spacedrive`
- For Linux or MacOS users run: `./.github/scripts/setup-system.sh`
  - This will install FFMPEG and any other required dependencies for Spacedrive to build.
- For Windows users run using PowerShell: `.\.github\scripts\setup-system.ps1`
  - This will install pnpm, LLVM, FFMPEG and any other required dependencies for Spacedrive to build.
  - Ensure you run it like documented above as it expects it is executed from the root of the repository.
- `pnpm i`
- `pnpm prep` - Runs all necessary codegen & builds required dependencies.

To quickly run only the desktop app after `prep` you can use:

- `pnpm desktop dev`

To run the landing page

- `pnpm web dev` - runs the web app for the embed
- `pnpm landing dev`

If you are having issues ensure you are using the following versions of Rust and Node:

- Rust version: **1.63.0**
- Node version: **17**

##### Mobile app

To run mobile app

- Install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) for Android and [Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/xcode/id497799835) for IOS development
- `./.github/scripts/setup-system.sh mobile`
  - The should setup most of the dependencies for the mobile app to build.
- You must also ensure [you must have NDK 24.0.8215888 and CMake](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/install-ndk#default-version) in Android Studio
- `cd apps/mobile && pnpm i` - This is a separate workspace, you need to do this!
- `pnpm android` - runs on Android Emulator
- `pnpm ios` - runs on iOS Emulator
- `pnpm dev` - For already bundled app - This is only temporarily supported. The final app will require the Spacedrive Rust code which isn't included in Expo Go.

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.

- Fill the "Ready for review" template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request.
- Don't forget to [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge.
  Once you submit your PR, a team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request for additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/managing-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.

### Your PR is merged!

Congratulations :tada::tada: The Spacedrive team thanks you :sparkles:.

Once your PR is merged, your contributions will be included in the next release of the application.

### Common Errors

#### `xcrun: error: unable to find utility "xctest", not a developer tool or in PATH`

You either don't have Xcode installed, or don't have the Xcode command line tools in your `PATH`.

- Install XCode from the Mac App Store
- Run `xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer`.
  This will use Xcode's developer tools instead of macOS's default tools.
