# Search

Press CTRL+F while on a Spacedrive window to access search.

By default you will search the active library, however by checking "Search all Libraries" you can perform a simotanious search of all libraries loaded on a Node.

Search results return Objects, Locations, Albums, Tags and Spaces

Search can be filtered by `ObjectKind`, as well as dates.
