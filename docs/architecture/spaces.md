# Spaces

Spaces are virtual folders that can be shared publically on the internet, or privately with friends, family and teams. Spaces contain [Objects]() which can be physically stored on any connected Node, or by Spacedrive as a service. Objects can be organised and presented spacially, with various layouts and variable grid placements. Color theme, icon packs and typeogrpahy can be customized per Space.



Objects can be added to a Space manually, or by matching a defined ruleset, similar to Tags.

Spacedrive comes with pre-defined Spaces, such as: photos, videos, screenshots, documents, .
